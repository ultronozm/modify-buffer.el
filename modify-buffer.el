;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides functions to apply unified diff format changes
;; to Emacs buffers, designed especially for LLM tool integration.
;;
;; It offers several implementations:
;; - modify-buffer-apply-diff-basic: A simple implementation
;; - modify-buffer-apply-diff-patch: Uses the external 'patch' command
;; - modify-buffer-apply-diff-improved: A robust implementation with better
;;   whitespace and context handling
;;
;; See the README for integration with some llm packages.
