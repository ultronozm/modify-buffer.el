#+title: modify-buffer.el - Apply diffs to Emacs buffers for LLM tools

* Overview

=modify-buffer= provides functions to apply unified diff format changes to Emacs buffers, designed specifically for Language Model tools integration.

This is an experiment, and is not at the level of aider, cursor, etc.

*Features:*
- Test suite
- Multiple implementations
- Flexible matching

*Available implementations:*
- =modify-buffer-apply-diff-basic=: Simple implementation
- =modify-buffer-apply-diff-patch=: Uses external 'patch' command
- =modify-buffer-apply-diff-improved=: More robust implementation with better whitespace handling, insensitivity to line numbers (recommended)

You can control which is used via the customization option =modify-buffer-default-implementation=.

I'll note that the patch-based solution doesn't work so well for me, because the line numbers/totals provided by LLM's are typically not so accurate.

* Installation

Install manually (download, =package-install-file=) or, e.g., via elpaca:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package modify-buffer
  :ensure (:host github :repo "ultronozm/modify-buffer.el"))
#+end_src

* Integration with LLM Packages

** [[https://github.com/karthink/gptel][gptel]]

#+begin_src elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'gptel
  (setq
   gptel-tools
   (mapcar
    (lambda (spec) (apply #'gptel-make-tool spec))
    (list
     (list
      :name "modify_buffer"
      :function (lambda (buffer diff)
                  (modify-buffer-log-call buffer diff)
                  (modify-buffer-apply-diff buffer diff))
      :description "Modify buffer contents using unified diff format.  Small, atomic changes preferred!"
      :args (list '(:name "buffer"
                          :type string
                          :description "The name of the buffer to modify")
                  '(:name "diff"
                          :type string
                          :description "The changes to apply in unified diff format (with @@ hunks and +/- lines)"))
      :category "emacs"
      ;;
      ;; ...plus whatever other tools you use.
      ;;
      )))))
#+end_src

See the documentation of =llm
Like the above, but with =#'llm-make-tool= in place of =#'gptel-make-tool=

(will add later, after I get around to updating the public version of that package)

# #+begin_src elisp
# (require 'modify-buffer)

# (setq ai-org-chat-tools
#       (mapcar
#        (lambda (spec) (apply #llm-make-tool spec))
#        (list
#         (list
#          :name "modify_buffer"
#          :function (lambda (buffer diff)
#                      (modify-buffer-log-call buffer diff)
#                      (modify-buffer-apply-diff buffer diff))
#          :description "Modify buffer contents using unified diff format.  Small, atomic changes preferred!"
#          :args (list '(:name "buffer"
#                              :type string
#                              :description "The name of the buffer to modify")
#                      '(:name "diff"
#                              :type string
#                              :description "The changes to apply in unified diff format (with @@ hunks and +/- lines)"))
#          :category "emacs"
#         ;;
#         ;; ...plus whatever other tools you use.
#         ;;
#         )))
# #+end_src

* Testing

Run the test suite against any implementation:

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'modify-buffer-test)
(modify-buffer-test-with-implementation #'modify-buffer-apply-diff
  (ert "modify-buffer-test-*"))
#+end_src

* Debugging

=modify-buffer-debug-enabled= controls whether we log diff attempts in the buffer ~*modify-buffer-debug*~.
